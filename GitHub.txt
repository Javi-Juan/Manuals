Steps to use GitHub
-------------------
•Created an open source repository
•Started and managed a new branch
•Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
•Opened and merged a Pull Request


Repository
----------
Proyecto que engloba todo tipo de archivos

Branch
------
"Rama" o versiones distintas del proyecto. Son clones donde trabajamos antes de subirlo al original o master

Commit
------
"cometer" - realizar cambios
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Pull Request
------------
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

Merge
-----
In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.
